  Helloo, my name is Maruki! Though I go by many other names such as Mar, Uki, Pygalgia, I'm fine with anything! I'm mostly afk/offtab in PonyTown in that small area under
  the phighting area. Sometimes I'm with a friend who sits beside/in front of me, we may be moving around for no reason but we're talking through whispers. If you want to 
  interact with me, please whisper first! Expect a delayed reply because I'm away from my computer most of the time. I'm alright with cuddling and hiding as well, you don't 
  have to ask!

  Even though I prefer English over my native language (Filipino), please expect grammar errors here and there, I'm still trying to work on it :') I'm also a very awkward 
  person ESPECIALLY when it comes to conversations or at least a small talk. I'm not fit enough to carry on a conversation, so if you strike one, it's up to you if you want
  it to keep going.

   I'm a very nervous and awkward wreck at first but trust!! I can be quite a chatterbox once we know/talk to each other enough. I will most definitely mirror your personality, though. It's the only thing I can do to get along. But if we know each other or talk to each other long enough, I'll eventually act more like myself
