  Hello hello! I'm Maruki, you can call me Mar or Uki. Anything else is fine as long as it isn't offensive. I'm mostly afk or offtab on PonyTown so I suggest you to whisper before talking to me! Expect a delayed reply. Sometimes I'm with a friend and we usually move around without talking, but we're just communicating through whispers. I'm also very c+h friendly, it's nice to have company sometimes.

  Even though I prefer English over my native language, Filipino, expect some typos and grammar here and there. I reply late and type fast and don't really proofread what I typed before sending it.

   I'm a very nervous and awkward wreck at first, especially very quiet! I don't socialize that much aside from one or two friends, but I'll try my best to talk <3 Just expect some awkwardness and all that. I might not be able to carry on a conversation, so if you decide to strike one, it's up to you if you wanna keep going!

   Some more stuff about me, I'm an artist! I love love Roblox Myths, two being Days Union (myth), Grocery Gang and Smiles Family. I love Ramshackle, Genshin Impact even though I don't play as much, and Roblox. Also, the two rentries are basically the same, just different themes.

  have a nice day!
